# Architecture Overview

## What You're Working With

This is a modern, minimal portfolio built with proven technologies. Understanding the architecture will help you customize and extend it effectively.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router for fast, modern web apps
- **TypeScript** - Adds type safety to catch errors before they happen
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid, consistent styling
- **JSON Data** - Simple content management without complex databases

## Why This Architecture?

1. **Simple to Update** - Change content by editing JSON files, no database needed
2. **Type Safe** - TypeScript catches errors before they reach users
3. **Fast Performance** - Next.js optimizes everything automatically
4. **Easy Styling** - Tailwind makes consistent design simple
5. **Accessible** - Built-in accessibility features for all users
6. **Responsive** - Works perfectly on mobile and desktop

## How It's Organized

```
minimal/
├── 📱 app/              # Pages and layouts (Next.js)
├── 📊 data/             # Your content (JSON files)
├── 🧩 src/              # All the code
│   ├── components/      # UI pieces
│   ├── lib/            # Utilities
│   └── types/          # TypeScript definitions
└── 📚 docs/            # Documentation
```

## The Data Flow

1. **Content** lives in JSON files (`/data` folder)
2. **Components** read and display this content
3. **TypeScript** ensures everything matches up correctly
4. **Tailwind** makes it look good
5. **Next.js** builds it into a fast website

## Component Architecture

### Three Types of Components

**🎯 Feature Components** - The main sections of your portfolio

- Education, Experience, Projects, Skills, etc.
- Each reads from a specific JSON file
- Displays your content in a structured way

**🏢 Layout Components** - Structure and navigation

- Header (your intro and name)
- Footer (contact information)
- Provides the overall page structure

**🧩 UI Components** - Reusable interface elements

- Tags, buttons, links, sections
- Used throughout the app for consistency
- Pre-styled and theme-aware

### How Components Work Together

```
Page Layout
├── Header (your intro)
├── Education (from education.json)
├── Experience (from experiences.json)
├── Projects (from projects.json)
├── Skills (from skills.json)
├── Social Links (from socials.json)
├── Footer (from footer.json)
└── Note (personal message)
```

## Data Management

### Simple JSON Files

- No database setup required
- Easy to edit with any text editor
- Version control friendly
- Automatic validation to catch errors

### Type Safety

- TypeScript interfaces define data structure
- Compilation errors if data doesn't match
- IntelliSense support in your editor
- Runtime validation with helpful error messages

### Example Data Flow

```
data/projects.json → TypeScript interface → React component → Styled UI
```

## Styling System

### Tailwind CSS Benefits

- **No custom CSS needed** - Use utility classes
- **Consistent design** - Predefined spacing, colors, typography
- **Responsive by default** - Mobile-first approach
- **Dark mode support** - Built-in theme switching

### Design Tokens

- **Primary color**: Customizable green theme
- **Typography**: IBM Plex Sans font family
- **Spacing**: Consistent 8px-based scale
- **Breakpoints**: Mobile-first responsive design

## Performance Features

### Next.js Optimizations

- **Static Generation** - Pages pre-built for speed
- **Image Optimization** - Automatic image resizing and formats
- **Code Splitting** - Only load what's needed
- **Font Optimization** - Efficient font loading

### Built-in Features

- **SEO Ready** - Proper meta tags and structured data
- **Accessibility** - WCAG compliant components
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Works without JavaScript
- **Fast Builds** - Optimized development and production builds

## Development Experience

### Type Safety Benefits

- **Catch errors early** - Before they reach users
- **Better IDE support** - Auto-completion and suggestions
- **Refactoring safety** - Rename things with confidence
- **Documentation** - Types serve as inline documentation

### Hot Reload Development

- **Instant feedback** - See changes immediately
- **Preserved state** - UI state maintained during edits
- **Error overlay** - Clear error messages in development
- **Fast refresh** - Quick iteration cycle

## Deployment & Hosting

### Vercel (Recommended)

- **Automatic deployment** - Push to Git, auto-deploy
- **Global CDN** - Fast loading worldwide
- **Serverless functions** - If needed for future features
- **Analytics** - Built-in performance monitoring

### Other Platforms

- **Netlify** - Similar features to Vercel
- **GitHub Pages** - Free static hosting
- **Any static host** - Builds to standard HTML/CSS/JS

## Customization Points

### Easy Changes

- **Content** - Edit JSON files in `/data`
- **Colors** - Modify `tailwind.config.ts`
- **Fonts** - Change in `app/layout.tsx`
- **Layout** - Reorder components in `app/page.tsx`

### Advanced Changes

- **New sections** - Add components + data files
- **Styling** - Customize Tailwind configuration
- **Features** - Add React components
- **Integrations** - Connect to APIs or services

## Why These Choices?

### Next.js

- **Industry standard** - Used by major companies
- **Great performance** - Automatic optimizations
- **Developer friendly** - Excellent tooling and documentation
- **Future proof** - Active development and community

### TypeScript

- **Reduces bugs** - Catch errors at compile time
- **Better refactoring** - Safe code changes
- **Team friendly** - Clear interfaces and contracts
- **Industry trend** - Most modern projects use TypeScript

### Tailwind CSS

- **Rapid development** - Style without leaving HTML
- **Consistent design** - Pre-defined design system
- **Small bundle size** - Only ships CSS you use
- **Maintainable** - No CSS file management

### JSON Data
